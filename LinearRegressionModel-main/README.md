# Linear Regression Model
A simple linear regression is a way to model the linear relationship between two quantitative variables, using a line drawn through those variables' data points, known as a regression line.

## Introduction
* Created a model to showcase the MPG vs Weight with a correlation matrix to test the response and precictor variables. For this example, 
a linear regression involving two variables, the response variable is the variable being modeled or predicted, while the predictor variable is 
the variable used to predict the response. The linear regression model uses mpg as the response variable and weight as the predictor variable.

## Explanation

## Data 
* Import the data into a dataframe and randomly pick 30 observstions without replacement.

## Plot the Yields
* Create a plot to show the variables MPG against Weight.

## Linear Regression results
* Create the simple linear regression model with MPG as the response vraiable and Weight as the predictor variable.
